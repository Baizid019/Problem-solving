Chef's phone shows a Battery Low notification if the battery level is 15%

or less.

Given that the battery level of Chef's phone is X%

, determine whether it would show a Battery low notification.
Input Format

    First line will contain T

, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, an integer X

    , denoting the battery level of the phone.

Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line Yes
, if the battery level is 15% or below. Otherwise, print No

.

You may print each character of Yes
and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, YeS, YES, yes

will be considered identical).
Constraints

    1≤T≤100

1≤X≤100

3
15
3
65

Sample Output 1

Yes
Yes
No

Explanation

Test Case 1: The battery level is 15

. Thus, it would show a battery low notification.

Test Case 2: The battery level is 3
, which is less than 15

. Thus, it would show a battery low notification.

Test Case 3: The battery level is 65
, which is greater than 15. Thus, it would not show a battery low notification

n computing, the collection of four bits is called a nibble.

Chef defines a program as:

    Good, if it takes exactly X

nibbles of memory, where X

    is a positive integer.
    Not Good, otherwise.

Given a program which takes N

bits of memory, determine whether it is Good or Not Good.
Input Format

    First line will contain T

, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N

    , the number of bits taken by the program.

Output Format

For each test case, output Good
or Not Good in a single line. You may print each character of Good or Not Good in uppercase or lowercase (for example, GoOd, GOOD, good

will be considered identical).

Explanation

Test case 1: The program requires 8
bits of memory. This is equivalent to 84=2 nibbles. Since 2

is an integer, this program is good.

Test case 2: The program requires 17
bits of memory. This is equivalent to 174=4.25 nibbles. Since 4.25

is not an integer, this program is not good.

Test case 3: The program requires 52
bits of memory. This is equivalent to 524=13 nibbles. Since 13

is an integer, this program is good.

Test case 4: The program requires 3
bits of memory. This is equivalent to 34=0.75 nibbles. Since 0.75 is not an integer, this program is not good

Chef started watching a movie that runs for a total of X

minutes.

Chef has decided to watch the first Y
minutes of the movie at twice the usual speed as he was warned by his friends that the movie gets interesting only after the first Y

minutes.

How long will Chef spend watching the movie in total?

Note: It is guaranteed that Y

is even.
Input Format

    The first line contains two space separated integers X,Y

    - as per the problem statement.

Output Format

    Print in a single line, an integer denoting the total number of minutes that Chef spends in watching the movie.

Constraints

    1≤X,Y≤1000

Y

    is an even integer.

Subtasks

Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints
Sample Input 1

100 20

Sample Output 1

90

Explanation

For the first Y=20
minutes, Chef watches at twice the usual speed, so the total amount of time spent to watch this portion of the movie is Y2=10

minutes.

For the remaining X−Y=80
minutes, Chef watches at the usual speed, so it takes him 80

minutes to watch the remaining portion of the movie.

In total, Chef spends 10+80=90

minutes watching the entire movie.
Sample Input 2

50 24

Sample Output 2

38

Explanation

For the first Y=24
minutes, Chef watches at twice the usual speed, so the total amount of time spent to watch this portion of the movie is Y2=12

minutes.

For the remaining X−Y=26
minutes, Chef watches at the usual speed, so it takes him 26

minutes to watch the remaining portion of the movie.

In total, Chef spends 12+26=38
minutes watching the entire movie.
