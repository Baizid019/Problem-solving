Problem Statement

In a certain programming contest, T-shirts are awarded to participants according to the following rules.

    All participants who ranked 

A-th or higher get a T-shirt.
Additionally, from the participants who ranked between
(A+1)-th and B-th (inclusive),

    C participants chosen uniformly at random get a T-shirt.

There were
1000 participants in this contest, and all of them got different ranks.
Iroha-chan, who participated in this contest, ranked

X-th.
Find the probability that she gets a T-shirt.
Constraints

    All values in input are integers.

1≤A<B≤1000
1≤C≤B−A

    1≤X≤1000

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

A 

B 

C 

X

Output

Print the answer. Your output will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error from the judge's answer is at most

10−6.

Sample Output 1
Copy

0.042553191489

Iroha-chan ranked
103-rd.
She will get a T-shirt if she is among the 20 participants chosen uniformly at random from the 470 participants who ranked between 31-st and 500-th, which happens with probability

47020​=0.04255319….
Sample Input 2

Problem Statement

You are given a string
S. Find the lexicographically smallest string S′ obtained by permuting the characters of

S.

Here, for different two strings
s=s1​s2​…sn​ and t=t1​t2​…tm​,

s<t holds lexicographically when one of the conditions below is satisfied.

    There is an integer 

i (1≤i≤min(n,m)) such that si​<ti​ and sj​=tj​ for all integers
j (1≤j<i).
si​=ti​ for all integers i (1≤i≤min(n,m)), and

    n<m.

Constraints

S is a string of length between 1 and

    2×105 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

S

Output

Print the lexicographically smallest string
S′ obtained by permuting the characters in

S.
Sample Input 1
Copy

aba

Sample Output 1
Copy

aab

Three strings can be obtained by permuting aba:

    aba
    aab
    baa

The lexicographically smallest among them is aab.
Sample Input 2
Copy

zzzz

Sample Output 2
Copy

zzzz
