Janmansh has to submit 3 assignments for Chingari before 10 pm and he starts to do the assignments at X pm. Each assignment takes him 1

hour to complete. Can you tell whether he'll be able to complete all assignments on time or not?
Input Format

    The first line will contain T

- the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer X

    - the time when Janmansh starts doing the assignemnts.

Output Format

For each test case, output Yes if he can complete the assignments on time. Otherwise, output No.

You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).
Constraints

    1≤T≤10

1≤X≤9

Sample Input 1

2
7
9

Sample Output 1

Yes
No

Explanation

Test case-1: He can start at 7
pm and finish by 10

pm. Therefore he can complete the assignments.

Test case-2: He can not complete all the 3
assignments if he starts at 9 pm.

Janmansh received X coins of 10 rupees and Y coins of 5

rupees from Chingari. Since he is weak in math, can you find out how much total money does he have?
Input Format

    The first line will contain T

- the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers X
, Y - the number of 10 and 5

    rupee coins respectively.

Output Format

For each test case, output how much total money does Janmansh have.
Constraints

    1≤T≤100

0≤X,Y≤100

Sample Input 1

2
2 1
3 4

Sample Output 1

25
50

Explanation

Test case-1: He has 2
coins of 10 rupees and 1 coin of 5 rupees. Hence he has 2⋅10+5=25

rupees.

Test case-2: He has 3
coins of 10 rupees and 4 coins of 5 rupees. Hence he has 3⋅10+4⋅5=50 rupees

Janmansh and Jay are playing a game. They start with a number X and they play a total of Y

moves. Janmansh plays the first move of the game, after which both the players make moves alternatingly.

In one move, a player can increment or decrement X
by 1

.

If the final number after performing Y

moves is even, then Janmansh wins otherwise, Jay wins. Determine the winner of the game if both the players play optimally.
Input Format

    The first line will contain T

- the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers X
, Y

    - the starting number and the total number of moves respectively.

Output Format

For each test case, output the winning player (Janmansh or Jay).

You may print each character of Janmansh and Jay in uppercase or lowercase (for example, JAY, jaY, JAy will be considered identical).
Constraints

    1≤T≤100

1≤X,Y≤100

Sample Input 1

2
2 2
4 3

Sample Output 1

Janmansh
Jay

Explanation

Test case-1: The starting number is X=2

. One of the optimal games will be:

    In the first move, Janmansh increases X

to 3
.
In the second move, Jay increases X
to 4

    .

Since the final number is even, Janmansh wins.

Test case-2: The starting number is X=4

. One of the optimal games will be:

    In the first move, Janmansh decreases X

to 3
.
In the second move, Jay decreases X
to 2
.
In the third move, Janmansh increases X
to 3

    .

Since the final number is odd, Jay wins.

Janmansh is at the fruit market to buy fruits for Chingari. There is an infinite supply of three different kinds of fruits with prices A, B and C

.

He needs to buy a total of X
fruits having at least 2

different kinds of fruits. What is the least amount of money he can spend to buy fruits?
Input Format

    The first line of the input contains a single integer T

- the number of test cases. The description of T
test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space separated integers X
, A, B, C

    - the number of fruits to buy and the prices of the three different types of fruits respectively.

Output Format

For each test case, output the least amount of money he can spend to buy fruits.
